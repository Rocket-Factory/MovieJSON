It is based on Paola Calvetti\u2019s book \u201cElisabetta II: Ritratto di Regina\" (Elizabeth II: Portrait of the Queen). The documentary is directed by one of the world\u2019s most sought-after photographers, Fabrizio Ferri.\nAmong the others, contributions of: David Montgomery, Brian Aris, Chris Levine, John Swannell, Jason Bell, Julian Calder.\nI preferred to shoot their \u2018portraits\u2019 in the studio, with a pictorial light, in a black \"box\", portraying them dressed in black. Their stories, their emotions in recalling them, their experiences with the Queen which they shared with me - Fabrizio Ferri.\nCharles Dance will embody the great legends of photography like Cecil Beaton, Bryan Adams, Lord Snowdon, Jousuf Karsch, also through their own words, written in diaries like Cecil Beaton\u2019s memoires. It\u2019s not just a narrative voice, but a real presence that forms the backbone of the film - Fabrizio Ferri.\nThe original soundtrack is by Remo Anzovino.\nContributions by Isabella Rossellini, Susan Sarandon, Pierpaolo Piccioli among the others.\nImages of the Queen, and a focus on each of her most intense, intimate, faithful portraits, emblems of the history of the 20th Century, alternate with conversations held with some of the photographers who portrayed Her Majesty, as well as those with Isabella Rossellini (one of the most photographed women in the world, who has graced the most magazine covers in the history of publishing), Pierpaolo Piccioli (one of the most important, internationally acclaimed stylists, a man who has always worked on images and with images) and Susan Sarandon (who met the Queen in person and gives viewers a more private, intimate reflection on the role, obligations and complexities of being a monarch).\nProduced by Nexo Digital with RAI Cinema", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2022", "card_subtitle": "2022 / \u610f\u5927\u5229 / \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / Fabrizio FERRI", "id": "35904082", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"], "title": "\u5973\u738b\u7684\u8096\u50cf", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/35904082/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["90\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "108288", "name": "\u5317\u4eac", "uid": "beijing"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u4e03\u4e03|\u70c2\u67ef\u4ebabot", "reg_time": "2007-04-15 15:23:58", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1511232/", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1511232", "avatar": "https://img1.doubanio.com/icon/up1511232-147.jpg", "type": "user", "id": "1511232", "uid": "ruawas"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2890367162/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img2.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2890367162.webp", "width": 1131, "height": 1600, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img2.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2890367162.webp", "width": 424, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img2.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2890367162.webp", "width": 424, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2890367162", "create_time": "2023-04-08 09:09:13", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/35904082", "type": "photo", "id": "2890367162", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2890367162/"}, "cover_url": "https://img2.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2890367162.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4c423e", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/35904082/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u610f\u5927\u5229"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/35904082/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Portrait of the Queen", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/35904082", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "f_tags": ["2022", "\u610f\u5927\u5229", "\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247", "Fabrizio", "FERRI"]}
